      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class="about-me">
        I'm a 4th year computer science student currently looking for an
        internship. I enjoy programming and solving problems among many other
        things. This website is a personal project I created to teach myself
        basic web development using online web resources, such as video guides
        and documentation. Web development is one of the skills I am currently
        teaching myself along with AWS. When I'm not programming I enjoy playing
        sports, working out, and going on hikes, where I sometimes take
        pictures.
